![Sharon DiOrio Headshot](diorio_headshot.jpg "Sharon DiOrio")

After a long tenure developing web apps with conventional technologies, she is thrilled to be building internal apps in BI and Analytics with a JS-only stack (AngularJS, Node.js, Mongodb) at Euro-Pro LLC, a consumer products manufacturer in Newton MA. Her current scheme to eradicate all Sharepoint apps and most SQL in the company is going exactly as planned [insert evil laugh here]. In her spare time, she is the "Head Instigator‚Äù of the AngularJS-Boston Meetup, and enjoys starting religious debates on hot topics like semi-colon usage, IDE choices and 2 vs. 4 space indentations. She has a BFA from SMU and a Masters with honors from RTFM.
